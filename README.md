# This repository tracks my personal learning progress throughout my career. 

It is not intended to teach others, but rather to document my own progress. The code shared here may not be suitable for production use, as the focus is on learning and experimentation rather than creating finished products. 

Ultimately, the goal of learning to code is not just to know how to program, but to use programming as a tool to solve problems and create new products, services, and experiences. Learning GraphQL, for example, is not an end in itself, but rather a means to make development processes more efficient and collaborative. The ultimate goal is always to create something meaningful and useful.
